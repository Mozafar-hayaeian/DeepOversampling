**DeepOversampling**
This repository provides resources, links, and references for various oversampling techniques, focusing on deep generative models used to address class imbalance in datasets. It covers both traditional and modern methods, as discussed in our paper.

**Overview**
Imbalanced datasets often lead to biased model predictions. Oversampling techniques, both traditional and generative, help mitigate this issue by increasing the representation of minority classes. This repository summarizes key methods and links to related academic papers and any available code repositories.
