**DeepOversampling**

This repository provides resources, links, and references for various oversampling techniques, focusing on deep generative models used in machine learning to address class imbalance in datasets. It covers both traditional and modern methods, as discussed in our paper.


**Overview**

Imbalanced datasets in machine learning often lead to biased model predictions, as models tend to favor the majority class. Oversampling techniques, including both traditional and deep generative approaches, help mitigate this issue by increasing the representation of minority classes. This repository summarizes key methods and provides links to related academic papers and available code repositories, offering a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in machine learning.
